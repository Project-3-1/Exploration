"""
Script to make the drone explore the room in order to find the landing platform.
It will take off, fly forward till it is close to a wall. Then it will turn and fly parallel to the wall.
Afterwards it will fly in a "rectangular pattern".
This approach should work for simple squared rooms.

The demo is ended by either pressing Ctrl-C or by holding your hand above the
Crazyflie.

For the example to run the following hardware is needed:
 * Crazyflie 2.0
 * Crazyradio PA
 * Flow deck
 * Multiranger deck
